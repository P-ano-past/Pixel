# Getting Started with Pixel

The idea is that the user should be able to click on the pixel and have the ability to select the color the use wants from a set array of colors, and the pixel should change color to that selected color.

## Project:

6/16 started with installing create react app, installing bootstrap, and
beginning the process for the grid.

6/23 CSS and formatting for the cells, got the on click to work for individual cells, proceeding with being able to select specific colors.

7/14 constructed grid, formatted css for grid, implemented color select panel, implemented selectable color

-- need to figure out timing for the color select, need to start planning on discord roles.
