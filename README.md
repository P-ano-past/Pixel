# Getting Started with Pixel

The idea is that the user should be able to click on the pixel and have the ability to select the color the use wants from a set array of colors, and the pixel should change color to that selected color.

## Project:

6/16 started with installing create react app, installing bootstrap, and
beginning the process for the grid.

6/23 CSS and formatting for the cells, got the on click to work for individual cells, proceeding with being able to select specific colors.

7/14 constructed grid, formatted css for grid, implemented color select panel, implemented selectable color

8/2 changed context and state handling to address timing for color select and cell selection.

## ToDo:

-- need to start planning on discord roles.
---- Discord should be able to handle the following: Show user's username when hovering over cell, the user should see a display at the bottom of the grid OR the color select section that shows a countdown. if countdown is showing, colors should be displayed as disabled.
